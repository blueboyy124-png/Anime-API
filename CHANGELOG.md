# Changelog

## v1.2.0
- Fixed critical response format bug: all endpoints now return {success: true, results: data}
- Root cause: createApiRoutes() had (app, jsonResponse, jsonError) but was called with (jsonResponse, jsonError), shifting all params
- Every jsonResponse() call was actually calling jsonError(), returning {success: false, message: data}
- Health endpoint worked because it used res.json() directly, bypassing the wrapper
- All 18 endpoints verified working: health, stats, search, suggestions, filter, trending, popular, upcoming, recent, spotlight, schedule, info, characters, relations, recommendations, episodes, watch
